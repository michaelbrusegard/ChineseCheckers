Chinese checkers is a board game played by two to six players. The objective of the game is to move all of your pieces from your starting triangle to the opposite triangle before your opponents do the same. Each player takes turns moving one piece at a time, either by moving a single space or by jumping over other pieces. A player can jump over their own pieces or their opponents' pieces, but they must land in an empty space on the other side. The game ends when one player successfully moves all of their pieces to the opposite triangle.
