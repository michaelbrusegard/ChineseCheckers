# Chinese Checkers
Chinese checkers is a board game played by two to six players. The objective of the game is to move all of your pieces from your starting triangle to the opposite triangle over a hexagonal grid before your opponents do the same. Each player takes turns moving one piece at a time, either by moving a single space or by jumping over other pieces. You can jump over your own pieces or your opponents' pieces, but you must land in an empty space on the other side. The goal of the game is to successfully move all of your pieces to the opposite triangle.

This is an implementation of the game in javafx. There is implemented functionality to highlight and/or enforce all the legal moves. The game operates by first clicking the desired piece you want to move, then clicking the desired location. It is also possible to save the current game state to a file and load it up again.
